Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           246 out of   9,312    2%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               723 out of   9,312    7%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            434 out of   4,656    9%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     434 out of     434 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     434   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         745 out of   9,312    8%
    Number used as logic:               723
    Number used as a route-thru:         22

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 34 out of     232   14%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.57

Peak Memory Usage:  375 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  12 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   10 secs
